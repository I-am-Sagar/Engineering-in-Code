## 01. Arrays

Array is the simplest data structure, which you must have come across even when you were learning your programming language. 

In this data structure, we keep elements/data in sequence and then access each data point/element within it using the appropriate index. 

For example, 
```c++
int arr[] = {10, 5, 7, 9, -4, 0, 1}
// We access the element '7' as:
printf("%d", arr[2]) // prints '7'
```

But what all can we do with such arrays? Well, here is the list of concepts which are related to arrays.
