## 04. Queues 

In computer science, a *queue* is a collection of entities that are maintained in a sequence and can be modified by the addition of entities at one end of the sequence and the removal of entities from the other end of the sequence. By convention, the end of the sequence at which elements are added is called the *back, tail, or rear* of the queue, and the end at which elements are removed is called the *head or front* of the queue, analogously to the words used when people line up to wait for goods or services.

The operation of adding an element to the rear of the queue is known as **enqueue**, and the operation of removing an element from the front is known as **dequeue**. Other operations may also be allowed, often including a **peek** or **front** operation that returns the value of the next element to be dequeued without dequeuing it.

The operations of a queue make it a **first-in-first-out (FIFO)** data structure. In a FIFO data structure, the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed. This is equivalent to the requirement that once a new element is added, all elements that were added before have to be removed before the new element can be removed. A queue is an example of a linear data structure, or more abstractly a sequential collection.

Following is the list of concepts related to queues, very similar to that of stacks.
