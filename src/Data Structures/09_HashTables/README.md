## 09. Hashing & HashTables

We know that if we have *n* data points, we can perform a search operation in *O(log n)* time using binary search or binary search tree. 

But what if I say I need a method that could perform the search operation even faster? Can I achieve *O(1)* search time? Quite ambitious. Isn't it? Well, we will see in this module if we are able to achieve this time complexity for searching or not. This module is more of a theoretical topic, but we will write some code wherever required. 

Here is the list of concepts related to hashing. 

| Concept | Description |
