## Engineering in Code

I am redoing my four years of engineering, but this time - by writing code for most of the concepts I learnt back then. _Why!?_ Simply because I feel that there are some subjects from academia which are so important even in professional life, the knowledge which they impart is immensely useful, and I want to understand them thoroughly. **And if I can code something, I have understood it!**

Let's first see how my engineering journey looks like!
